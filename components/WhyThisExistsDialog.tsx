                        I was at college when my computer science teacher asked
                        me to share a file I had been working on to our google
                        classroom, and that meant I had to log into my google
                        account on a university computer. I take my privacy
                        seriously, and so I typically dont login using such
                        accounts on random computers. Even if I wanted to share
                        it with my phone, I would have to open WhatsApp web or
                        any other service with a login. So the idea came to me
                        to build an anonymous sharing platform, where you can
                        share you files and retreive them without any
                        authentication needed. Seamless, and hassle-free! ðŸ˜ƒ
